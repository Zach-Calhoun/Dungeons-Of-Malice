# Dungeons-Of-Malice
Work in progress Roguelike in C++ and SDL
(c) Zaharia Radu

This is my first github project. 

Dungeons of Malice is a roguelike written in C++ and SDL. The code is quite a mess but I hope 
I can keep adding to it and keep it manageable. The purpose of this project is more of a learning
exercise.

Planned features:
- Procedurally generated caves, dungeons and maybe an overworld
- Different types of monsters
- Random items with random properties
- TBA
